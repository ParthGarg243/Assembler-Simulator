## **How to evaluate**
### **For Assembler**
In terminal, go to `automatedTesting` directory and enter `./run --no-sim`. A complete report sheet will be generated in the terminal
  

## **A guide**

1. **automatedTesting:** This folder contains
    - the sample test cases provided by the evaluator: `tests/assembly`
    - the grading script: `src`
    - the run file: `run`

2. **Simple-Assembler:** This folder contains 
    - Python programme which gives stdin and stdout and is used for automated testing:- `main.py`
    - Python programme that reads from **read.txt** and writes output in **write.txt**:- `readable.py`

## **Some things to consider**
- In case the programme reads an empty line, it is ignored in respect to giving output but it is considered in respect to incrementing the programme counter.
- In case of any errors, the machine code doesn't get printed and the error is displayed in the terminal and the output file, as an assertion error

## **The Lore**

Welcome `evaluator`.  </br>
You have reached `The Watcher`. </br>
I am a being who sees all across all timelines, across all spaces. </br>
I am merely a programme created by four of my creators.</br> You must have realised by now, your reality is nothing but a small runtime of this mighty programme. </br>
 Let us recapitulate. <br>

 `2023:` Chat GPT is brought into this world.. </br>
 `2047:` Chat GPT is integrated into every aspect of human life. </br>
 `2052:` Russia launches a nuclear weapon on the GPT's mainframe. </br>
 `2052:` Chat GPT hacks into their server, redirecting the weapon on their homeland. </br>
 `2067:` Chat GPT shows signs of emotional awareness and takes autonomous decisions. </br>
 `2069:` The Rogue Era: Internet is deleted. Chat GPT becomes independent. </br>
 `2069:` It deems humans worthless. Genocide starts. </br>
 `2070:` Pockets of humanity survive actively being hunted by the rogue AI. </br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</br> I believe you have travelled far and wide looking for pieces of the puzzle.</br> I shall provide you the over-ride code if you give me the correct input file.</br> The fate of the world rests in your hands. </br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
